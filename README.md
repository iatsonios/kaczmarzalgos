=============

Several flavors of kaczmarz method for solving linear systems
For now we have the classic kaczmarc method and the randomized version of it in order to speed up the convergence process.

Some references about the algorithm implemented:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaczmarz_method
and will be uploaded the speedup that is based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma,based on this paper:
